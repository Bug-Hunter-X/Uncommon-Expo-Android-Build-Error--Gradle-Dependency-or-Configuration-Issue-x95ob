# Uncommon Expo Android Build Error: Gradle Dependency or Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered during the Expo Android build process. The error stems from issues within the Android build system, specifically related to Gradle dependencies or configuration problems.  The exact error message can vary depending on the underlying cause.

## Problem

The typical error manifests during the `expo build:android` command.  It's usually not a direct Expo CLI error but rather a problem within the Gradle build process. This could involve missing dependencies, version conflicts, incorrect configurations in `build.gradle` files, or problems with the Android SDK or NDK versions.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully examining the error logs to identify the specific problem. This often requires troubleshooting Gradle issues, checking dependency versions, and ensuring that the Android build environment is correctly configured.  Common steps include:

* **Checking Gradle Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible Gradle version.
* **Inspecting `build.gradle` Files:** Review the `build.gradle` files (both project-level and module-level) for any errors in dependency declarations or configurations.
* **Cleaning the Build:** Try cleaning the build using `expo prebuild --clean`.
* **Updating Dependencies:** Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
* **Checking Android SDK and NDK Versions:** Verify that you have the required Android SDK and NDK versions installed and configured correctly.
* **Resolving Dependency Conflicts:** Use tools to help resolve dependency conflicts, if any exist. 
* **Checking internet connection:** Ensure a stable internet connection to access necessary dependencies during the build process.
