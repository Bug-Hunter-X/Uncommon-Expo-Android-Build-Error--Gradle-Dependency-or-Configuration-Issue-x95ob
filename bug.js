This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android build process. It's not directly an Expo CLI bug but rather a problem during the Android build steps that Expo uses.  The exact error message can vary, but it frequently involves issues with Gradle, dependencies, or other aspects of the Android build system. For example, you might see errors related to missing dependencies, incorrect configurations in `build.gradle` files, or issues with the Android SDK or NDK versions.
