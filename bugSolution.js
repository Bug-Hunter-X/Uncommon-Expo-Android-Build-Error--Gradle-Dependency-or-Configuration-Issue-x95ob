The solution involves careful debugging and problem-solving based on the specific error messages. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Examine the full error log:** The detailed error message and stack trace from `expo build:android` are crucial.  Look for specific clues about the missing dependency, configuration problem, or version conflict.

2. **Check `build.gradle` files:**  Inspect your `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/settings.gradle` files for errors. Common problems include typos, incorrect dependency declarations, or missing plugins.

3. **Clean and rebuild:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` before attempting to build again.

4. **Update dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies (including Expo and any native modules) are up to date. Run `expo update` and review your `package.json` file.

5. **Check Android environment:**  Ensure the Android SDK, NDK, and build-tools are properly installed and configured.  Consult the Expo documentation for specific Android environment requirements.

6. **If using a specific native module:** If you're using a native module that could be causing issues, consult its documentation or the module's issue tracker for help.

Example (Illustrative - Replace with actual code from error log):

//Potential Problem in build.gradle (Incorrect dependency)
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.example:wrong-dependency:1.0'
}

//Solution: Correct the dependency
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.example:correct-dependency:1.0'
}

Remember to replace the placeholder dependency with the actual one from your error message.
